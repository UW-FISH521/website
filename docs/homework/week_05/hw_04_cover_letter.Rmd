## Instructions

Write a cover letter for a submission to a journal using the template below. Base your letter upon the paper you chose for HW #1 as though it were your own original manuscript. Alternatively, you may choose to base your letter upon a paper you are currently getting ready to submit.


## Submission

When you are finished, attach your Word document to an email or provide a link to a Google document, such that Mark will be able to provide comments directly on the draft itself (ie, do not paste it into the body of an email)
