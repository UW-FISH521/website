<div id="course-overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Course overview</h1>
<p>This class was originally designed to help students prepare research
proposals. It has undergone various modifications since its inception,
as different instructors have been placed in charge of it, and as the
needs of students have changed. The course still includes the
development of scientific ideas into coherent proposals, but it now also
addresses other forms of communication, and aspects of professional
development to help graduate students during and after their time at the
University of Washington.</p>
<p>Before one can write a scientific proposal, one needs to know how
scientific papers are conceptualized and written, as they are the basic
template for proposals. Accordingly, the class will include the elements
of crafting scientific papers, and each student will choose one to
examine closely. This will clarify many lessons related to the structure
of scientific papers, and the use of published literature and other
sources of data and information. Scientific papers typically result from
formal or informal proposals, and knowing how papers are written helps
inform the process of developing proposals.</p>
<p>Proposal development starts with an idea, which is then placed in the
context of what is already known, and the needs in the scientific
community and society at large for further information. Students will go
through this process, learning the mechanics of proposal writing, and
providing constructive feedback on written and oral presentations of
student proposals.</p>
<p>Another vital component of being a scientist is the ability to review
colleagues’ work critically, but constructively. Once you become
established, you will receive many manuscripts and grant proposals to
review each year. While such reviews are usually anonymous (that is, the
authors do not know your identity), editors and panelists know who you
are and you will quickly establish a reputation as a reviewer. It is
important that you criticize the work according to rigorous scientific
standards, but you should keep in mind that your review may have
significant effects on other people’s career and job prospects.</p>
<p>Many of you already know that you need to produce a research proposal
for your thesis work, to be submitted to your committee and to be
included in your graduate student file. Guidelines for such proposals
can be found on the SAFS web page. This class is a very good opportunity
to work on your proposal, and I suggest that you use the time and
feedback to produce at least a draft by the end of the class. I will be
very happy to help you towards this aim, in class, outside class and in
future.</p>

<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of the quarter, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>search a publication database like Web of Science or Google
Scholar for papers of interest</p></li>
<li><p>use a message box to refine scientific questions and
objectives</p></li>
<li><p>write a cover letter for a publication that conveys the
importance of the work and its relevance to the journal</p></li>
<li><p>review a proposal or manuscript using language that is critical
of the work, but not the authors themselves</p></li>
<li><p>create a scientific presentation that conveys the question of
interest, the study objective(s), and findings of interest</p></li>

<h1>Classroom conduct</h1>
<p>I am dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive learning
environment for all students, regardless of their background, identity,
physical appearance, or manner of communication. Any form of language or
behavior used to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort will not be
tolerated. This applies to all course participants (instructor,
students, guests). In order to foster a positive and professional
learning environment, I ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please let me know if you have a name or set of preferred
pronouns that you would like me to use</p></li>
<li><p>Please let me know if <em>anyone</em> in class says something
that makes you feel uncomfortable<sup>[<a
href="#endnotes">1</a>]</sup></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I encourage the following kinds of behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use welcoming and inclusive language</p></li>
<li><p>Show courtesy and respect towards others</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge different viewpoints and experiences</p></li>
<li><p>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although I strive to create and use inclusive materials in this
course, there may be overt or covert biases in the course material due
to the lens with which it was written. Your suggestions about how to
improve the value of diversity in this course are encouraged and
appreciated.</p>

<div id="access-accommodations" class="section level1">
<h1>Access &amp; accommodations</h1>
<p>All students deserve access to the full range of learning
experiences, and the University of Washington is committed to creating
inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
and state laws. If you feel like your performance in class is being
impacted by your experiences outside of class, please talk with me.</p>
<div id="disabilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have already established accommodations with Disability
Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved
accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your
needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through
DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that
requires accommodations (<em>e.g.</em>, mental health, learning, vision,
hearing, physical impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at
206-543-8924 or via <a href="mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu">email</a> or their <a
href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">website</a>. DRS offers
resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable
accommodations are established through an interactive process between
you, your instructor(s) and DRS.</p>
</div>
<div id="religious-observances" class="section level3">
<h3>Religious observances</h3>
<p>Students who expect to miss class or assignments as a consequence of
their religious observance will be provided with a reasonable
accommodation to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Absence from
class for religious reasons does not relieve students from
responsibility for the course work required during the period of
absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the
instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on
which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an
opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable
time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="excused-absence" class="section level1">
<h1>Excused absence</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend class and to participate in all
graded activities. A student who is anticipating being absent from class
due to a Religious Accommodation activity needs to complete the
Religious Accommodations request process by the second Friday of the
quarter. Students who anticipate missing class due to attendance at
academic conferences or field trips, or participation in
university-sponsored activities should provide a written notice to the
instructor ahead of the absence. The instructor will determine if the
graded activity or exam can be rescheduled or if there is equivalent
work that can be done as an equivalent, as determined by the
instructor.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="technology" class="section level1">
<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>This course will revolve around hands-on computing exercises that
demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly
recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are
certainly free to work with one another. <strong>For students without
access to a personal laptop</strong>: it is possible to check out UW
laptops for an entire quarter (see the <a
href="https://education.uw.edu/admissions/office-of-student-services">Student
Services office</a> for details).</p>
<p>Students will be required to have a user account on <a
href="https://github.com/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>, which we will be
using for file hosting and communications via its “Discussions” and
“Issues” features. If you do not already have an account, you can sign
up for a free one <a
href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a>. The
instructor will provide training on how to use the intended features in
<strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="teaching-methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>Teaching methodology</h1>
<p>This course will introduce new material primarily through prepared
slides and hands-on demonstrations. Students will be expected to work
both individually and collaboratively (to the extent possible given the
current conditions); course content and evaluation will emphasize the
communication of ideas and the ability to think critically more so than
a specific pathway or method. Other areas of this website provide an
overview of the topics to be covered, including links to weekly reading
assignments, lecture materials, and homework assignments.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level1">
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>This course will involve a <em>lot</em> of communication between and
among students and the instructor. Short questions should be addressed
to me via email; I will try my best to respond to your message within 24
hours. Under more normal circumstances, detailed questions would be
addressed to me in person–either after class or during a scheduled
meeting. In this case, however, we will schedule one-on-one or group
Zoom calls as needed.</p>
<p>In addition to email and Zoom, we will use the “Issues” feature in
<strong>GitHub</strong> to ask questions and assist others.
Specifically, questions and answers can be posted to the issues in the
course’s “assistance” repository <a
href="https://github.com/FISH497/assistance/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level1">
<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<p>Students will be evaluated on their knowledge of course content and
their ability to communicate their understanding of the material via
individual homework assignments. There will be 7 homework assignments,
each with varying weight on your final grade. Please note, <strong>all
assignments must be turned in to achieve a passing grade</strong>.</p>
<p>Homework will be assigned each Monday and will be due by 1:30 PM the
following Monday, with the exception of the final assignment, which will
be due by 11:59 PM on March 13. Late homework will be assessed a penalty
of 10% per day. The instructor will evaluate and return student homework
assignments within one week of their due date. <strong>If for some
reason you cannot meet the homework deadline, contact the instructor as
soon as possible to discuss other options</strong>. Please see the <a
href="homework.html">Homework</a> page for more details.</p>
<div id="participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>This course will require students to engage with the instructor and
one another in small groups. I expect all students to contribute to our
discussions and I will use random call-outs as a means for hearing from
everyone.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic integrity</h1>
<p>Faculty and students at the University of Washington are expected to
maintain the highest standards of academic conduct, professional
honesty, and personal integrity. Plagiarism, cheating, and other
academic misconduct are serious violations of the <a
href="https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/academic-misconduct/">Student
Conduct Code</a>. I have no reason to believe that anyone will violate
the Student Conduct Code, but <em>I will have no choice</em> but to
refer any suspected violation(s) to the College of the Environment for a
Student Conduct Process hearing. Students who have been guilty of a
violation will receive zero points for the assignment in question.</p>

<h1>Food Pantry</h1>
<p>No student should ever have to choose between buying food or
textbooks. The UW Food Pantry helps mitigate the social and academic
effects of campus food insecurity. They aim to lessen the financial
burden of purchasing food by providing students access to shelf-stable
groceries, seasonal fresh produce, and hygiene products at <strong>no
cost</strong>. Students can expect to receive 4 to 5 days’ worth of
supplemental food support when they visit the Pantry, located on the
north side of Poplar Hall at the corner of NE 41<sup>st</sup> St and
Brooklyn Ave NE. Visit the <a href="https://uw.edu/anyhungryhusky">Any
Hungry Husky website</a> for additional information, including operating
hours and additional food support resources.</p>

student uncomfortable, the student should feel free to contact the
Director of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.</p>
