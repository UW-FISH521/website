Becoming a good writer
</font>


## Good writing resource

[Heard SB. 2016. *The Scientistâ€™s Guide to Writing*. Princeton University Press.](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/the-scientists-guide-to-writing/)


## Writing is hard

* Very few writers are geniuses--most find it difficult and time-consuming

> -  Writing is a craft, which can be improved through practice & deliberate attention

> - Developing good writing behavior is part of the process


## Reading & writing go hand-in-hand

* When reading, make notes about things you (dis)like

> - If you like a paper, why do you feel that way?

> - What wording, structure, and graphics do you find most effective?

> - If you don't like a paper, or it's hard to understand, what elements are you struggling with?


## Writing behavior

Writing typically goes slowly for 2 reasons:

1. Lots of time spent writing, editing, rephrasing, reorganizing

2. Distractions


## Sound familiar?

Heard (2016, p22) writes

"For instance, after opening the blank document that was to become [Chapter 4], but before writing anything past the title, I checked my email four times, read news articles in the New York Times and the Toronto Globe and Mail, went to the greenhouse to weed (unnecessarily) goldenrods growing for an experiment, read the latest postings on a baseball blog, a computer-security blog, and two economics blogs, and thought hard about whether is was close enough to noon to heat up my lunch. (Sadly it wasn't.)"


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Reminders**

> - Put a sticky note on your monitor that asks, "*How* are you writing?"

> - Are you actually writing or doing something else?


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Writing log**

> - Choose a 2+ hour block for writing

> - Set an alarm for every 6-10 minutes and note what you've been doing


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Cooperation**

> - Discuss behaviors with a friend or colleague

> - Send copies of daily accomplishments or exchange writing logs


## Behavioral challenges

**Avoidance**

> - Procrastinators ("I need a snack")

> - Intential non-starters ("I'll wait for the moment")


## Behavioral challenges

**Distraction**

> - Consider your environment and time of day

> - What else is going on in your life?


## Behavioral challenges

**Feeling stuck ("Writer's block")** 

> - Lower your standards

> - Divide and conquer

> - Change your environment or take a break

> - Talk it out

> - Freewrite


## Behavioral challenges

**Perfectionism**

> - Try to get *something* on paper & edit it later

> - Chris Harley, my former officemate and current professor at UBC used to say, "Write drunk. Edit sober." (Note that I do not endorse this behavior.)


## Behavioral challenges

**Fear of criticism**

> - Red ink can be triggering

> - Accept constructive criticism and make it work for you

Searching the literature
</font>


## Finding papers of interest?

* Word of mouth

* Journal table of contents

* Online searches


## Web of Science (WOS)

* WOS is a powerful and popular option

* Find it online [here](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/az.php)


## Google Scholar

* Google Scholar is another option

* Find it online [here](https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en)

* **Note**: results will vary between WOS & Google

Reference management
</font>


## Staying organized

### Reference management software has 2 benefits:

1. keeps your references organized and easily searchable

2. (generally) integrated with word processing software to create citations and literature cited section


## Software options
