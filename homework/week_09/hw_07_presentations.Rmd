## Background

Your assignment this week is to give a live presentation of your proposal idea **in class** on March 4. Your presentation should cover the following elements:

* Background and rationale for your proposed research

* Questions of interest (or hypotheses to test)

* Methods/approach

* Anticipated results

* Implications (intellectual merit)


## Evaluation rubric

Mark will evaluate the quality of your presentation based on the following criteria:

* Title slide with name, affiliation, and contact info

* Acknowledgment of collaborators and funders

* Layout/design of the slides (eg, good color contrast, appropriate font size)

* Speaking clearly and addressing the audience rather than the computer or slides

* Presenting the background and clear rationale for the study

* Brief explanation of the methods or approach

* Highlighting expected results and any potential difficulties

* Brief comment(s) on the implications of the research

* Appropriate ending


## Presentation upload

Please note that due to our tight time frame in class, **you are required to upload your presentation no later than 12:30 PM Pacific Standard Time on February 28** using [this link](https://forms.gle/st4cSc3Z9htH4FyG8). Also note that **presentations will only be accepted in either presentation** (`.ppt`, `.pptx`) **or PDF** (`.pdf`) **formats**. If you use an `.html` format (eg, ioslides, Xaringan), you will need to print your slide deck to a `.pdf` format using your browser's print function.


## Schedule

Here is the schedule for the day. **Note that everyone has a total of 7 minutes for their presentation**. This includes Mark's introduction of you and any Q&A.

```{r schedule, echo = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)
set.seed(521)

## set class roster
roster <- c(
  "Backstrom",
  "Bengtsson",
  "Bishop",
  "Cattau",
  "Chambers",
  "Code",
  "Doran",
  "Hennings",
  "Hiwatari",
  "Jameson",
  "Mantegna",
  "Pendleton",
  "Peraza",
  "Setzke",
  "Simeon",
  "Stone",
  "Tanja",
  "Veggerby",
  "Wang",
  "Zahner"
  )

## order of presentations
p_order <- c(sample(roster, length(roster)))

## people & breaks
items <- c("**[ Introduction ]**", p_order[1:7], "**[ Break ]**",
           p_order[8:14], "**[ Break ]**", p_order[15:20], "**[ Wrap-up ]**")

## date of presentations
start_date <- as.POSIXct("2022-02-28 13:30")
## dates in seconds past `start_date`
dates_sec <- c(0, 48, 96, 97, 98) * 3600
## presentation & break times in seconds past the hour
p_times_1 <- seq(5, by = 7, length.out = 7)
break_1 <- 54
p_times_2 <- seq(65, by = 7, length.out = 7)
break_2 <- 113
p_times_3 <- seq(125, by = 7, length.out = 7)
times <- c(0, p_times_1, break_1, p_times_2, break_2, p_times_3) * 60
## formal times
date_times <- start_date + times

## nicer formatting
date_times <- as.POSIXct(date_times, origin = "1970-01-01")
date_times <- format(date_times, "%I:%M")
## drop leading 0
date_times <- sub("0(\\d)", "\\1", date_times)

## full schedule
schedule <- data.frame(Time = date_times,
                       Speaker = items)

## create & print table
kableExtra::kable(schedule, format = "html", caption = " ",
                  align = "cc", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "6em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "15em")
```

(The order of presentations was determined by random draw. You can see the code [here](https://github.com/UW-FISH521/website/blob/bec2a9e8b7ac8eecada021c198501890c91b0ace/homework/week_09/hw_07_presentations.Rmd#L63-L130).)
